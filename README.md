2. [Installation](#installation)
3. [Usage](#usage)

## 1. Prerequisites

We are moving over to [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) but still with a sprinkling of [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).
Docker will allow us to easily define the server requirements of each project alongside the code and VirtualBox is enabling us to do
this without any major performance loss.

### Docker

[Docker for Mac](https://download.docker.com/mac/stable/Docker.dmg)

If your computer is a bit older you won't be able to install the above but don't worry just install [Docker Toolbox](https://github.com/docker/toolbox/releases/tag/v1.12.3) instead.

### VirtualBox

[VirtualBox for Mac](http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/5.1.10/VirtualBox-5.1.10-112026-OSX.dmg)

### Homebrew

Homebrew is "The missing package manager for macOS", pretty much it lets you easily install packages similar to `apt-get` on linux.

Run the following command to install it:

`[ ! -f "`which brew`" ] && /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`
